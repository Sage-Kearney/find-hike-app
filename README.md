### App Aesthetics
Inspired by REI and other outdoor companies, and taking my users into consideration, I chose to fill this app with warm earthy tones usually found in canyons tucked away in the southwest or mid west regions. The header font is casual, yet grabs your attention, while also providing a friendly, approachable feel. The body font is slim, minimal, and easy to read- similar to the overal design of the app.

### How it works-using API's 
To get my app to work, I needed to use two API's. In order to retrieve the right information from the Hiker Project API (aka the hikes based on a certain location), I needed to find the longitude & lattitude for the location input by the user. So to do that, I used the Mapquest API to grab the user input, translate the location into lat & long, and then infuse that data into my fetch call to the Hiker Project API. Having all of the right information in the right places is what enabled me to render the data on the page, providing a seamless user experience.
